# ClubExpress SDK Development Progress

This document tracks the progress of the ClubExpress SDK development.

## Current Status

We have completed the initial project setup and implemented the core HTTP client and authentication module. The SDK now has the following capabilities:

- Project structure and configuration files
- Core HTTP client with cookie management and error handling
- Authentication module with login and logout functionality
- Unit tests for the HTTP client and authentication module

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Authentication

#### 1.1 Project Setup
- [x] Initialize project structure
- [x] Set up initial documentation
- [x] Create implementation plan
- [x] Set up basic package.json with dependencies
- [x] Configure testing framework (Jest)
- [x] Set up linting and code formatting
- [x] Create .env file for credentials

#### 1.2 HTTP Client Implementation
- [x] Create base HTTP client class
- [x] Implement request/response handling
- [x] Add cookie/session management
- [x] Implement retry logic
- [x] Add logging and debugging capabilities
- [x] Write tests for HTTP client

#### 1.3 Authentication Module
- [x] Implement login functionality
- [x] Implement logout functionality
- [x] Add session validation
- [x] Create authentication tests
- [x] Document authentication API

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Court Booking - First Vertical Slice

#### 2.1 Court Discovery
- [ ] Implement method to find all courts
- [ ] Implement method to find available courts by date/time
- [ ] Add filtering capabilities (court type, features)
- [ ] Create tests for court discovery
- [ ] Document court discovery API

## Challenges and Solutions

### Authentication Flow
We implemented the authentication flow by analyzing the ClubExpress login form and extracting the necessary form fields (VIEWSTATE, VIEWSTATEGENERATOR, EVENTVALIDATION). The login process involves:
1. Fetching the login page to extract form fields
2. Submitting the login form with credentials
3. Checking for error messages in the response
4. Extracting user information if login is successful

### Cookie Management
We implemented cookie management in the HTTP client to maintain session state across requests. This is crucial for authenticated operations.

## Next Session Plan

For the next development session, we will focus on implementing the court discovery functionality, which is the first part of the court booking vertical slice. This will involve:

1. Analyzing the ClubExpress court listing pages
2. Implementing methods to fetch and parse court information
3. Adding filtering capabilities for court discovery
4. Writing tests for the court discovery functionality
5. Documenting the court discovery API

See `docs/development/next-session-plan.md` for detailed plans for the next session.
