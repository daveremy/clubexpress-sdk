# Next Development Session Plan

## Session Goal: Implement Court Discovery Functionality

For the next development session, we will focus on implementing the court discovery functionality, which is the first part of the court booking vertical slice.

## Tasks

### 1. Analyze ClubExpress Court Listing Pages
- Examine the HTML structure of the court listing pages
- Identify the endpoints for fetching court information
- Determine how court availability is represented
- Document the findings

### 2. Create Court Module Structure
- Create the court module directory structure
- Define the core types for courts and availability
- Set up the module interface

### 3. Implement Court Discovery Methods
- Implement method to find all courts
- Implement method to find available courts by date/time
- Add filtering capabilities (court type, features)
- Handle pagination if necessary

### 4. Write Tests
- Create unit tests for the court discovery functionality
- Mock the ClubExpress responses
- Test different scenarios (no courts, multiple courts, filtering)

### 5. Document the API
- Add JSDoc comments to all methods
- Update the README with court discovery examples
- Document any limitations or edge cases

## Implementation Approach

1. We will start by creating a new module directory `src/modules/courts`
2. Define the core types in `src/modules/courts/types.ts`
3. Implement the court module in `src/modules/courts/courts.module.ts`
4. Create tests in `tests/modules/courts/courts.module.test.ts`
5. Update the main index.ts to export the new module

## Expected Challenges

- The court listing pages may have complex HTML structures
- Court availability might be loaded dynamically with JavaScript
- Filtering options might be complex or require multiple requests
- Pagination handling might be required for clubs with many courts

## Success Criteria

- The court discovery methods should work with the actual ClubExpress platform
- All tests should pass
- The API should be well-documented
- The module should be integrated into the main SDK export
