# ClubExpress SDK Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the ClubExpress SDK, focusing on delivering vertical slices of functionality with an HTTP-first approach.

## Core Principles

- **HTTP-First**: Prioritize HTTP requests over browser automation
- **Vertical Slices**: Deliver complete vertical slices of functionality
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Keep the codebase lean
- **Clean Architecture**: Maintain a clean, modular project structure
- **Test-Driven**: Ensure all functionality is thoroughly tested

## Testing Approach

Our testing strategy includes multiple layers to ensure the reliability of the SDK:

### Unit Tests
We write unit tests for individual components and methods, mocking external dependencies where appropriate.

### Integration Tests
We create integration tests that verify the interaction between different modules within the SDK.

### End-to-End Test Scripts
For each major module, we develop end-to-end test scripts that verify functionality against the actual ClubExpress platform:

1. **Authentication Test Script** (`scripts/test-auth.ts`): Tests the complete authentication flow, including login, session validation, and logout.

2. **Court Discovery Test Script** (planned): Will test the ability to find courts and check availability.

3. **Court Booking Test Script** (planned): Will test the ability to book courts and manage bookings.

These test scripts are run as part of our development process before committing changes to ensure we don't introduce regressions.
