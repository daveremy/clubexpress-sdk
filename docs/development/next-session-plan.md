# Next Development Session Plan

## Session Goal: Implement Club Configuration System

For the next development session, we will focus on implementing a club configuration system that allows for club-specific settings and rules. This is a critical enhancement that will make the SDK more flexible and adaptable to different clubs' needs, particularly for court booking rules which can vary significantly between clubs.

## Tasks

### 1. Design the Club Configuration Interface
- Define a comprehensive `ClubConfig` interface
- Identify all club-specific settings and rules
- Create a default configuration with sensible defaults
- Design a mechanism for injecting custom configurations

### 2. Update the Core Client
- Modify the `ClubExpressClient` constructor to accept a configuration object
- Implement configuration merging with defaults
- Add methods to access and update configuration at runtime
- Update relevant tests

### 3. Refactor Court Booking Validation
- Replace hardcoded rules with configuration-based validation
- Update the `validateBookingAgainstClubRules` method to use configuration
- Ensure backward compatibility for existing code
- Add tests for different configuration scenarios

### 4. Update the CLI Tool
- Modify the CLI to use the configuration system
- Add ability to display current configuration
- Implement command-line options to override configuration settings
- Update help documentation

### 5. Document the Configuration System
- Add JSDoc comments to all configuration-related code
- Create examples of custom configurations for different club scenarios
- Update the README with configuration examples
- Document all available configuration options

## Implementation Approach

1. We will create a new file `src/core/config.ts` for the configuration interface and defaults
2. Update the client constructor in `src/core/client.ts` to accept configuration
3. Refactor the validation logic in `src/modules/courts/courts.module.ts`
4. Update the CLI tool in `scripts/courts-cli.ts`
5. Add tests for configuration in `tests/core/config.test.ts`
6. Update documentation to include configuration examples

## Development Process

To maintain the quality and reliability of our SDK, we'll follow these practices during development:

1. **Run Existing Tests**: Before committing any changes, run the existing tests to ensure we haven't broken any functionality.

2. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests for the configuration system before implementing it.

3. **Incremental Development**: Implement and test one feature at a time, ensuring each component works before moving to the next.

4. **Documentation Updates**: Keep documentation updated as we implement new features.

5. **CLI Testing**: Manually test the CLI tool to ensure it works with the new configuration system.

## Expected Challenges

- Ensuring backward compatibility with existing code
- Designing a flexible configuration interface that covers all club-specific rules
- Handling configuration validation and error reporting
- Balancing flexibility with usability
- Ensuring the configuration system is well-documented and easy to use

## Success Criteria

- The configuration system should be flexible enough to handle different club rules
- All tests should pass, including the existing tests
- The CLI tool should work with the new configuration system
- The API should be well-documented
- The implementation should follow our clean architecture principles
- The configuration system should be easy to use and understand

## Preparation

Before the next session, we should:

1. Identify all club-specific rules and settings that need to be configurable
2. Research best practices for configuration systems in TypeScript libraries
3. Review the existing validation logic to identify all hardcoded rules
4. Consider how the configuration system will evolve as we add more features
5. Run the existing tests to ensure we're starting with a solid foundation

## Configuration Interface Draft

Here's a draft of what the `ClubConfig` interface might look like:

```typescript
interface ClubConfig {
  // Court booking rules
  courtBooking: {
    maxDaysInAdvance: number;           // e.g., 7 days
    bookingWindowOpenTime: string;      // e.g., "13:00" (1:00 PM)
    maxBookingsPerDayPerMember: number; // e.g., 1
    timeSlotDurationMinutes: number;    // e.g., 90
    validStartTimes: string[];          // e.g., ["8:00", "9:30", "11:00", ...]
    requireMemberPresence: boolean;     // e.g., true
  };
  
  // Other club-specific settings can be added here
  // For example, event registration rules, membership settings, etc.
}
```

This interface will be refined during the implementation process.
