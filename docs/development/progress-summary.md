## Development Process

To ensure the reliability of our SDK, we've established the following development process:

### Authentication Testing

The authentication module is a critical foundation for all other functionality in the SDK. To prevent regressions, we run the authentication test script (`npm run test:auth`) before committing any changes that might affect authentication or the HTTP client.

This script performs a complete end-to-end test of the authentication flow:
1. Accessing the ClubExpress site
2. Logging in with valid credentials
3. Validating the session
4. Logging out

This test has proven invaluable for identifying subtle issues in our implementation, particularly around cookie handling and session validation. We consider this a first-class test that must pass before any changes are committed.

### Court Discovery Testing

Similar to the authentication testing, we've created a court discovery test script (`npm run test:courts`) that verifies the end-to-end functionality of the courts module. This script:

1. Logs in to the ClubExpress site
2. Finds all courts
3. Checks availability for today
4. Checks availability for tomorrow with time filters
5. Logs out

This test ensures that our court discovery functionality works correctly against the actual ClubExpress platform.

### Court Booking Testing

We've also created a court booking test script (`npm run test:court-booking`) that verifies the end-to-end functionality of the court booking features. This script:

1. Logs in to the ClubExpress site
2. Finds available courts for a specific date
3. Books a court
4. Retrieves the user's bookings
5. Cancels the booking
6. Logs out

This test ensures that our court booking functionality works correctly against the actual ClubExpress platform.

### Testing Strategy

We've implemented a comprehensive testing strategy for the courts module:

1. **Unit Tests**: We've created unit tests that verify the behavior of individual methods in isolation, with mocked dependencies.

2. **Integration Tests**: We've implemented integration-style tests that verify the interaction between different components of the module.

3. **End-to-End Tests**: We've created end-to-end tests that verify the functionality against the actual ClubExpress platform.

This multi-layered approach ensures that our implementation is robust and reliable, with good test coverage at all levels.

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Event Registration

#### 3.1 Event Discovery
- [ ] Implement method to find all events
- [ ] Implement method to find events by date range
- [ ] Add filtering capabilities (event type, category)
- [ ] Create tests for event discovery
- [ ] Create end-to-end test script for event discovery
- [ ] Document event discovery API

## Challenges and Solutions

### Authentication Flow
We successfully implemented the authentication flow by analyzing the ClubExpress login form and understanding its JavaScript behavior. Key insights and solutions included:

1. **Form Field Extraction**: We identified that the login form contains several hidden fields that need to be extracted and included in the login request.

2. **Password Encoding**: We discovered that the ClubExpress login form encodes the password in Base64 before submission, which we replicated in our implementation.

3. **Login Verification**: We implemented a robust session validation method that checks for multiple indicators of successful login:
   - Absence of login links/forms on protected pages
   - Presence of logout links
   - Presence of member-only content areas
   - Multiple page checks (profile page and dashboard)

4. **Cookie Management**: We enhanced the HTTP client to properly extract and manage cookies from response headers, which is crucial for maintaining the authenticated session.

5. **Error Handling**: We implemented comprehensive error handling with specific error codes and messages for different failure scenarios.

### Court Discovery Implementation

We implemented the court discovery functionality by analyzing the ClubExpress court listing and availability pages. Key aspects of the implementation include:

1. **Court Listing**: We identified the endpoints for court listings and implemented methods to extract court information from the HTML responses using cheerio for HTML parsing.

2. **Availability Checking**: We implemented methods to check court availability for specific dates and times, parsing the availability data from the HTML responses.

3. **Filtering Capabilities**: We added filtering options for court type, features, and time ranges to make it easier to find specific courts.

4. **Time Slot Parsing**: We implemented robust parsing of time slots from the availability pages, handling different time formats and calculating durations.

5. **Error Handling**: We added comprehensive error handling for court discovery operations, with specific error codes and messages for different failure scenarios.

6. **Testing Challenges**: We encountered challenges with testing the HTML parsing functionality, particularly with mocking the cheerio library. We resolved these by implementing integration-style tests that focus on the behavior rather than the implementation details.

### Court Booking Implementation

We implemented the court booking functionality by analyzing the ClubExpress court reservation system. Key aspects of the implementation include:

1. **Booking Form Analysis**: We identified the endpoints and form fields required for court booking, including hidden fields that need to be extracted from the booking form.

2. **Booking Confirmation**: We implemented methods to handle booking confirmations and extract booking details from the confirmation page.

3. **Cancellation Handling**: We added functionality to cancel existing bookings, including handling cancellation confirmations and errors.

4. **Booking Retrieval**: We implemented methods to retrieve a user's current bookings, with options to filter by date range.

5. **Error Handling**: We added comprehensive error handling for booking operations, with specific error codes and messages for different failure scenarios.

6. **Testing Strategy**: We implemented a robust testing strategy for the booking functionality, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

### Implementation Approach
Our implementation follows these key principles:

1. **HTTP-First**: We use direct HTTP requests rather than browser automation, making the SDK more efficient and reliable.

2. **Clean Architecture**: We maintain a modular structure with clear separation of concerns between the HTTP client, authentication module, and courts module.

3. **Comprehensive Testing**: We've implemented thorough tests that verify the functionality of all modules against the actual ClubExpress platform.

4. **Test-Driven Development**: We've adopted a test-driven approach, writing tests before implementing functionality to ensure that our implementation meets the requirements.

## Next Session Plan

For the next development session, we will focus on implementing the event registration functionality, which is the next vertical slice. This will involve:

1. Analyzing the ClubExpress event listing pages
2. Implementing methods to find events
3. Adding filtering capabilities for events
4. Writing tests for the event discovery functionality
5. Documenting the event discovery API

See `docs/development/next-session-plan.md` for detailed plans for the next session.
