# Next Development Session Plan

## Session Goal: Implement Event Discovery Functionality

For the next development session, we will focus on implementing the event discovery functionality, which is the first part of the event registration vertical slice. This builds on our successful court booking implementation.

## Tasks

### 1. Analyze ClubExpress Event Listing Process
- Examine the HTML structure of the event listing pages
- Identify the endpoints for retrieving events
- Determine the parameters for filtering events
- Analyze the event details pages
- Document the findings

### 2. Create Event Module
- Create a new event module in the SDK
- Define the types for events and event listings
- Implement the event discovery methods

### 3. Implement Event Discovery Methods
- Implement method to find all events
- Implement method to find events by date range
- Add filtering capabilities (event type, category)
- Implement method to get event details

### 4. Write Tests
- Create unit tests for the event discovery functionality
- Mock the ClubExpress responses for testing
- Test different scenarios (all events, filtered events, date ranges)
- Create integration tests for the event module

### 5. Create Event Discovery Test Script
- Create a test script for event discovery (`scripts/test-event-discovery.ts`)
- Ensure the script tests the end-to-end functionality of event discovery
- Include authentication as a prerequisite step
- Make the script runnable via npm script (`npm run test:events`)

### 6. Document the API
- Add JSDoc comments to all methods
- Update the README with event discovery examples
- Document any limitations or edge cases

## Implementation Approach

1. We will create a new module in `src/modules/events`
2. Define types in `src/modules/events/types.ts` for events
3. Implement the event discovery methods in `src/modules/events/events.module.ts`
4. Create tests in `tests/modules/events/events.module.test.ts`
5. Create a script for testing event discovery in `scripts/test-event-discovery.ts`
6. Update the documentation to include the new functionality

## Development Process

To maintain the quality and reliability of our SDK, we'll follow these practices during development:

1. **Run Existing Tests**: Before committing any changes, run the existing tests to ensure we haven't broken any functionality.

2. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests for the event discovery functionality before implementing it.

3. **Incremental Development**: Implement and test one feature at a time, ensuring each component works before moving to the next.

4. **Documentation Updates**: Keep documentation updated as we implement new features.

## Expected Challenges

- The event listing pages may have complex HTML structures
- Events may have different formats or types
- Date handling for recurring events
- Filtering events by various criteria
- Extracting detailed event information
- Handling pagination for large event lists

## Success Criteria

- The event discovery methods should work with the actual ClubExpress platform
- All tests should pass, including the existing tests
- The new event discovery test script should successfully verify the functionality
- The API should be well-documented
- The implementation should follow our HTTP-first approach
- The event discovery functionality should handle errors gracefully

## Preparation

Before the next session, we should:

1. Explore the ClubExpress event listing pages manually to understand the structure
2. Take screenshots or save HTML of relevant pages for analysis
3. Identify any club-specific customizations that might affect the implementation
4. Review the court discovery implementation for patterns we can reuse
5. Run the existing tests to ensure we're starting with a solid foundation
