## Development Process

To ensure the reliability of our SDK, we've established the following development process:

### Authentication Testing

The authentication module is a critical foundation for all other functionality in the SDK. To prevent regressions, we run the authentication test script (`npm run test:auth`) before committing any changes that might affect authentication or the HTTP client.

This script performs a complete end-to-end test of the authentication flow:
1. Accessing the ClubExpress site
2. Logging in with valid credentials
3. Validating the session
4. Logging out

This test has proven invaluable for identifying subtle issues in our implementation, particularly around cookie handling and session validation. We consider this a first-class test that must pass before any changes are committed.

### Court Discovery Testing

Similar to the authentication testing, we've created a court discovery test script (`npm run test:courts`) that verifies the end-to-end functionality of the courts module. This script:

1. Logs in to the ClubExpress site
2. Finds all courts
3. Checks availability for today
4. Checks availability for tomorrow with time filters
5. Logs out

This test ensures that our court discovery functionality works correctly against the actual ClubExpress platform.

### CLI Tool

We've developed an interactive CLI tool (`npm run cli:courts`) that demonstrates the SDK's functionality and provides a user-friendly interface for testing. The CLI tool includes:

1. **Authentication**: Login and logout functionality
2. **Court Discovery**: Finding available courts with date and time filters
3. **Full Day Grid View**: Displaying a visual grid of court availability for a specific date
4. **Debug Mode Toggle**: Enabling/disabling debug output for troubleshooting
5. **Colored Output**: Using chalk for improved readability and visual appeal

The CLI tool serves as both a demonstration of the SDK's capabilities and a practical utility for users who want to quickly check court availability from the command line.

### Testing Strategy

We've implemented a comprehensive testing strategy for the courts module:

1. **Unit Tests**: We've created unit tests that verify the behavior of individual methods in isolation, with mocked dependencies.

2. **Integration Tests**: We've implemented integration-style tests that verify the interaction between different components of the module.

3. **End-to-End Tests**: We've created end-to-end tests that verify the functionality against the actual ClubExpress platform.

4. **CLI Testing**: We've developed an interactive CLI tool that allows for manual testing and demonstration of the SDK's functionality.

This multi-layered approach ensures that our implementation is robust and reliable, with good test coverage at all levels.

## Next Steps

### Club Configuration Implementation

Our next focus is implementing a club configuration system that will make the SDK more flexible and adaptable to different clubs' needs. This will include:

1. **Configuration Interface**
   - Design a comprehensive `ClubConfig` interface
   - Identify all club-specific settings and rules
   - Create a default configuration with sensible defaults
   - Design a mechanism for injecting custom configurations

2. **Core Client Integration**
   - Modify the `ClubExpressClient` constructor to accept a configuration object
   - Implement configuration merging with defaults
   - Add methods to access and update configuration at runtime

3. **Validation Refactoring**
   - Replace hardcoded rules with configuration-based validation
   - Update the validation methods to use configuration
   - Ensure backward compatibility for existing code

4. **CLI Updates**
   - Modify the CLI to use the configuration system
   - Add ability to display current configuration
   - Implement command-line options to override configuration settings

This configuration system will be particularly important for court booking rules, which can vary significantly between different clubs using ClubExpress.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Authentication Flow
We successfully implemented the authentication flow by analyzing the ClubExpress login form and understanding its JavaScript behavior. Key insights and solutions included:

1. **Form Field Extraction**: We identified that the login form contains several hidden fields that need to be extracted and included in the login request.

2. **Password Encoding**: We discovered that the ClubExpress login form encodes the password in Base64 before submission, which we replicated in our implementation.

3. **Login Verification**: We implemented a robust session validation method that checks for multiple indicators of successful login:
   - Absence of login links/forms on protected pages
   - Presence of logout links
   - Presence of member-only content areas
   - Multiple page checks (profile page and dashboard)

4. **Cookie Management**: We enhanced the HTTP client to properly extract and manage cookies from response headers, which is crucial for maintaining the authenticated session.

5. **Error Handling**: We implemented comprehensive error handling with specific error codes and messages for different failure scenarios.

### Court Discovery Implementation

We implemented the court discovery functionality by analyzing the ClubExpress court listing and availability pages. Key aspects of the implementation include:

1. **Court Listing**: We identified the endpoints for court listings and implemented methods to extract court information from the HTML responses using cheerio for HTML parsing.

2. **Availability Checking**: We implemented methods to check court availability for specific dates and times, parsing the availability data from the HTML responses.

3. **Filtering Capabilities**: We added filtering options for court type, features, and time ranges to make it easier to find specific courts.

4. **Time Slot Parsing**: We implemented robust parsing of time slots from the availability pages, handling different time formats and calculating durations.

5. **Error Handling**: We added comprehensive error handling for court discovery operations, with specific error codes and messages for different failure scenarios.

6. **Testing Challenges**: We encountered challenges with testing the HTML parsing functionality, particularly with mocking the cheerio library. We resolved these by implementing integration-style tests that focus on the behavior rather than the implementation details.

### CLI Tool Implementation

We developed an interactive CLI tool to demonstrate the SDK's functionality and provide a user-friendly interface for testing. Key aspects of the implementation include:

1. **Interactive Menu**: We created a menu-driven interface that allows users to navigate through different features of the SDK.

2. **Colored Output**: We used the chalk package to add colored text output, improving readability and visual appeal.

3. **Debug Mode Toggle**: We implemented a debug mode toggle that allows users to enable or disable detailed debug output for troubleshooting.

4. **Grid Display**: We created a visual grid display for court availability, making it easy to see which courts are available at different times.

5. **User-Friendly Formatting**: We improved the formatting of dates, times, and court information to make the output more readable and user-friendly.

6. **Command-Line Arguments**: We added support for command-line arguments, such as `--debug`, to enable features from the start.

### Club-Specific Rules

We identified that many aspects of the court booking process are club-specific, such as:

1. **Booking Window**: The number of days in advance that bookings can be made (e.g., 7 days).

2. **Booking Open Time**: The time of day when bookings open for the maximum advance date (e.g., 1:00 PM).

3. **Booking Limits**: The number of courts a member can book per day (e.g., 1 court).

4. **Time Slot Duration**: The standard duration for court bookings (e.g., 90 minutes).

5. **Valid Start Times**: The specific times when bookings can start (e.g., 8:00 AM, 9:30 AM, etc.).

To address this, we're implementing a club configuration system that will make these rules configurable, allowing the SDK to be used by different clubs with different rules.

### Implementation Approach
Our implementation follows these key principles:

1. **HTTP-First**: We use direct HTTP requests rather than browser automation, making the SDK more efficient and reliable.

2. **Clean Architecture**: We maintain a modular structure with clear separation of concerns between the HTTP client, authentication module, and courts module.

3. **Comprehensive Testing**: We've implemented thorough tests that verify the functionality of all modules against the actual ClubExpress platform.

4. **Test-Driven Development**: We've adopted a test-driven approach, writing tests before implementing functionality to ensure that our implementation meets the requirements.

5. **User-Friendly Interfaces**: We've developed user-friendly interfaces, such as the CLI tool, to make the SDK more accessible and easier to use.

6. **Flexibility**: We're implementing a configuration system to make the SDK adaptable to different clubs' needs and rules.
