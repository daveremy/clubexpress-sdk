# ClubExpress SDK Development Progress

This document tracks the progress of the ClubExpress SDK development.

## Current Status

We have completed the initial project setup and successfully implemented the core HTTP client and authentication module. The SDK now has the following capabilities:

- Project structure and configuration files
- Core HTTP client with robust cookie management and error handling
- Authentication module with login, session validation, and logout functionality
- Comprehensive tests for the HTTP client and authentication module

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Authentication

#### 1.1 Project Setup
- [x] Initialize project structure
- [x] Set up initial documentation
- [x] Create implementation plan
- [x] Set up basic package.json with dependencies
- [x] Configure testing framework (Jest)
- [x] Set up linting and code formatting
- [x] Create .env file for credentials

#### 1.2 HTTP Client Implementation
- [x] Create base HTTP client class
- [x] Implement request/response handling
- [x] Add cookie/session management
- [x] Implement retry logic
- [x] Add logging and debugging capabilities
- [x] Write tests for HTTP client

#### 1.3 Authentication Module
- [x] Implement login functionality
- [x] Implement logout functionality
- [x] Add session validation
- [x] Create authentication tests
- [x] Document authentication API

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Court Booking - First Vertical Slice

#### 2.1 Court Discovery
- [ ] Implement method to find all courts
- [ ] Implement method to find available courts by date/time
- [ ] Add filtering capabilities (court type, features)
- [ ] Create tests for court discovery
- [ ] Document court discovery API

## Challenges and Solutions

### Authentication Flow
We successfully implemented the authentication flow by analyzing the ClubExpress login form and understanding its JavaScript behavior. Key insights and solutions included:

1. **Form Field Extraction**: We identified that the login form contains several hidden fields that need to be extracted and included in the login request.

2. **Password Encoding**: We discovered that the ClubExpress login form encodes the password in Base64 before submission, which we replicated in our implementation.

3. **Login Verification**: We implemented a robust session validation method that checks for multiple indicators of successful login:
   - Absence of login links/forms on protected pages
   - Presence of logout links
   - Presence of member-only content areas
   - Multiple page checks (profile page and dashboard)

4. **Cookie Management**: We enhanced the HTTP client to properly extract and manage cookies from response headers, which is crucial for maintaining the authenticated session.

5. **Error Handling**: We implemented comprehensive error handling with specific error codes and messages for different failure scenarios.

### Implementation Approach
Our implementation follows these key principles:

1. **HTTP-First**: We use direct HTTP requests rather than browser automation, making the SDK more efficient and reliable.

2. **Clean Architecture**: We maintain a modular structure with clear separation of concerns between the HTTP client and authentication module.

3. **Comprehensive Testing**: We've implemented thorough tests that verify the functionality of the authentication module against the actual ClubExpress platform.

## Next Session Plan

For the next development session, we will focus on implementing the court discovery functionality, which is the first part of the court booking vertical slice. This will involve:

1. Analyzing the ClubExpress court listing pages
2. Implementing methods to fetch and parse court information
3. Adding filtering capabilities for court discovery
4. Writing tests for the court discovery functionality
5. Documenting the court discovery API

See `docs/development/next-session-plan.md` for detailed plans for the next session.
