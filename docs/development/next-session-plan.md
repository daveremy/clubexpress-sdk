# Next Development Session Plan

## Session Goal: Implement Court Discovery Functionality

For the next development session, we will focus on implementing the court discovery functionality, which is the first part of the court booking vertical slice. This builds on our successful authentication implementation.

## Tasks

### 1. Analyze ClubExpress Court Listing Pages
- Examine the HTML structure of the court listing pages
- Identify the endpoints for fetching court information
- Determine how court availability is represented
- Document the findings

### 2. Create Court Module Structure
- Create the court module directory structure (`src/modules/courts/`)
- Define the core types for courts and availability (`types.ts`)
- Set up the module interface (`courts.module.ts`)

### 3. Implement Court Discovery Methods
- Implement method to find all courts
- Implement method to find available courts by date/time
- Add filtering capabilities (court type, features)
- Handle pagination if necessary

### 4. Write Tests
- Create unit tests for the court discovery functionality
- Mock the ClubExpress responses for testing
- Test different scenarios (no courts, multiple courts, filtering)
- Create an integration test that uses the authentication module

### 5. Document the API
- Add JSDoc comments to all methods
- Update the README with court discovery examples
- Document any limitations or edge cases

## Implementation Approach

1. We will start by creating a new module directory `src/modules/courts`
2. Define the core types in `src/modules/courts/types.ts`
3. Implement the court module in `src/modules/courts/courts.module.ts`
4. Create tests in `tests/modules/courts/courts.module.test.ts`
5. Create a script for testing court discovery in `scripts/test-courts.ts`
6. Update the main index.ts to export the new module

## Expected Challenges

- The court listing pages may have complex HTML structures
- Court availability might be loaded dynamically with JavaScript
- Filtering options might be complex or require multiple requests
- Pagination handling might be required for clubs with many courts
- Different clubs might have different court naming conventions

## Success Criteria

- The court discovery methods should work with the actual ClubExpress platform
- All tests should pass
- The API should be well-documented
- The module should be integrated into the main SDK export
- The implementation should follow our HTTP-first approach

## Preparation

Before the next session, we should:

1. Explore the ClubExpress court booking pages manually to understand the flow
2. Take screenshots or save HTML of relevant pages for analysis
3. Identify any club-specific customizations that might affect the implementation
4. Review the authentication module to ensure we can leverage it effectively for court discovery
